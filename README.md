# CSS-syntax
The CSS syntax consists of a set of rules. These rules have 3 parts: a selector, a property, and a value. One does not need to remember this.Once you start coding CSS and get comfy with it, you'll do so without thinking "this is a selector" or "that is a property"

selector { property: value }

The selector represents the HTML element that you want to style. B y this it means the part you want to alter in your HTML

The property is the CSS that will carry the value that will alter the HTML

Then the value is what implement the alter/change.

You can make your CSS code more readable by spreading your style declarations across multiple lines. You can also indent your code if you like. This doesn't affect how your code is rendered .

it just makes it easier for you to read,code that is easy to read makes it easy to debug and understand if working in a team.
